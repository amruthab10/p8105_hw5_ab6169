# Problem 1 

```{r}
birthdays = sample(1:365, 50, replace = TRUE)

repeated_bday= length(unique(birthdays)) < 50

repeated_bday

unique(c(1,2,3,4,5,1,1,3))
```

In a function
```{r}
bday_sim= function(n_room) {
  birthdays= sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday= length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
}

bday_sim(20)
```

```{r}
bday_sim_results= 
  expand_grid(
    bdays= 2:50, 
    iter= 1:10000
  ) |>  
  mutate(
    result= map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |>  
  summarize(
    prob_repeat= mean(result)
  )
```


Plot Showing the Probability as a function of group size 
```{r}
bday_sim_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bdays, y = prob_repeat)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Group size (n)",
    y = "Probability of at least one shared birthday",
    title = "Birthday paradox via simulation (10,000 runs per n)"
  )
```
Comments: This plot shows us how probability of at least two people sharing a birthday increases as the group size grows. When there are fewer than 10 people in the room, the probability is close to zero. This means that having a shared birthday is very unlikely. Meanwhile, as the group size approaches around 20-25 people, the probability rises and reaches to about 50%. I also observed that the curve begins to flatten after about 35 people.
