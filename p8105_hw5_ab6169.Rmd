# Problem 1 

```{r}
birthdays = sample(1:365, 50, replace = TRUE)

repeated_bday= length(unique(birthdays)) < 50

repeated_bday

unique(c(1,2,3,4,5,1,1,3))
```

In a function
```{r}
bday_sim= function(n_room) {
  birthdays= sample(1:365, n_room, replace = TRUE)

  repeated_bday= length(unique(birthdays)) < n_room

  repeated_bday
}

bday_sim(20)
```

```{r}
bday_sim_results= 
  expand_grid(
    bdays= 2:50, 
    iter= 1:10000
  ) |>  
  mutate(
    result= map_lgl(bdays, bday_sim)
  ) |> 
  group_by(
    bdays
  ) |>  
  summarize(
    prob_repeat= mean(result)
  )
```

plot this

```{r}
 bday_sim_results |>  
  ggplot(aes(x=bdays, y=prob_repeat))+ 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```
